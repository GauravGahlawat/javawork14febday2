Public static void main (String args []) 
1.The public keyword is an access specifies, which allows the programmer to control the visibility of class members. 
When a class member is preceded by public, then that member may be accessed by code outside the class in which it is declared. 
In this case, main ( ) must be declared as public. 

2.The keyword static allows main ( ) to be called without having to instantiate a particular instance of the class. 
This is necessary since main ( ) is called by the Java interpreter before any objects are made. 

3.The keyword void simply tells the compiler that main ( ) does not return a value. 

4.Main ( ) is the method, called when a Java application begins. 

5.String args [ ] declares a parameter named args, which is an array of instances of the class String.

6. In this case, args receives any command-line arguments present when the program is executed. 

7.With the same name as args we can?t define one more variable we will get CTE. 

8.PSVM (String [] p) p is a variable which is defined as a identifier.
